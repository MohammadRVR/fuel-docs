Networking templates support
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Starting with Fuel 7.0 you can use networking templates.
Templates allow for more flexible network configurations and provide
you with the following abilities:

* Ability to create additional networks (e.g. an extra network for Swift)
  and delete networks.
* Have a specific set of network roles.
* Ability to create a network only if a relevant node role is present
  on the node.
* Ability to provide custom networking topologies (e.g. subinterface bonding).

See :ref:`templates-networking-ops`.
