Reduced footprint
+++++++++++++++++

With the reduced footprint feature you can spawn virtual machines
on nodes.

This can be useful in the following scenarios (but not limited to them):

* Run a minimal two node cluster on a single physical machine.
* Put external services on the spawned virtual machines (e.g.
  a monitoring service).
* Run three controllers on virtual machines on three different physical
  machines.
