Fuel Master Node can be upgraded from 6.x to 7.0 GA
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you are running a Mirantis OpenStack 6.x environment,
you can upgrade your Fuel Master Node to Fuel 7.0.
Fuel can manage environments that were deployed with 6.x releases,
assuming that you created the environment with the earlier release
and upgraded the Fuel Master node rather than doing a fresh install.
For a list of OpenStack releases and versions that your Fuel Master
node can manage, click on the "Releases" tab at the top of your Fuel home page.

See :ref:`upgrade-ug` for details.

Upgrading the Fuel Master Node does not update the OpenStack environment.
