Rolling back a node to its original state
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Starting with Fuel 7.0, you can use the rollback feature to return
a node to its original state (e.g. the state before the node failed).
This can be used to revert changes during a failed upgrade or other
node malfunction.

See :ref:`rollback-ug`.
