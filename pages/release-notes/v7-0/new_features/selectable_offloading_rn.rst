Selectable offloading modes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can now select offloading modes for physical interfaces.
The number and the set of possible offloading types
depends on the interfaces' hardware and the current kernel version.

Fuel automatically detects the offloading modes for any given physical
interface, which you can edit through Fuel Web UI or Fuel CLI.

See :ref:`selectable-offload`.
