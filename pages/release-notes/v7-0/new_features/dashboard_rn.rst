The Dashboard tab in the Fuel Web UI is your go-to place to
review all the necessary information about your OpenStack environment.

This is where you can delete or rename your environment, discard
undeployed changes to an environment, start or stop the deployment,
access documentation, and view possible errors reported by Fuel.
