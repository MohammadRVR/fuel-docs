Configurable hostnames
++++++++++++++++++++++

You can define the hostnames of the slave
nodes through Fuel Web UI or CLI prior to deploying an environment.

.. note:: Whereas you can change the **node names** at any time (before
          the deployment or after it), you can only change the
          **hostnames** before the deployment. Hostnames are
          locked after the deployment and there is no way to change
          them.

See :ref:`assign-roles-ug`.
