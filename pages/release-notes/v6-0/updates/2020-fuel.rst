* The OCF scripts update procedure by RPM/DEB packages is introduced.
  See `LP1465771 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1465771>`_.
  However, there is no class for this package in Mirantis OpenStack 6.0.
  But you can install it manually.

  For Ubuntu::

   apt-get install fuel-ha-utils6.0

  For CentOS::

   yum install fuel-ha-utils6.0

  Run the above commands on all the cluster servers.
