Issues with Image Based Provisioning
====================================

Known issues with image based provisioning
------------------------------------------

Rebooting any node of a cluster with a Ubuntu image based provisioning
two times in a row will stop at the GRUB screen. The node will not
automatically boot until the user selects an option in the GRUB menu.
There is no timeout.
See `LP1465586 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1465586>`_.

Image building requires using a high I/O rate disk on the Fuel Master
node. Otherwise, the operation is likely to time out before the building
process completes successfully which will lead to the
"Timeout of provisioning is exceeded" error and the deployment will fail.
The issue is likely to appear when the Fuel Master node is deployed over
a QEMU/KVM virtual machine with the default disk settings.
