Known Limitations for the Mellanox SR-IOV Plugin
------------------------------------------------

In 6.1 release, Mellanox
is supported in :ref:`Experimental Mode <experimental-features-term>` only.
Nevertheless, it is no recommended
to use Mellanox features in this mode
as the whole upstream feature is deprecated and is not verified.
We recommend using the Mellanox plugin instead, which can be downloaded
from the
`Fuel Plugin Catalog <https://www.mirantis.com/products/openstack-drivers-and-plugins/fuel-plugins/>`_.
