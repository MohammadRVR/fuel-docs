Experimental features
---------------------

Mirantis OpenStack ships with experimental features
that you can enable and try out.
Experimental features provide functionality
that may be useful to some customers
but has not been subjected to the rigorous testing
that is required for environments
that need high levels of stability.

All features marked as experimental are unsupported
and should be used for non-Production/feedback purposes only.

Instructions for enabling experimental features
on a running Fuel Master node are provided in
:ref:`experimental-features-op`.
